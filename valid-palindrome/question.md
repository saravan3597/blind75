Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

Note: Alphanumeric characters consist of letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).

Example 1:

Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Output: true

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the input string.

Hint:

A palindrome string is a string that is read the same from the start as well as from the end. This means the character at the start should match the character at the end at the same index. We can use the two pointer algorithm to do this efficiently.
